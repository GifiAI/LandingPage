          During the initial training stage, we extended a pretrained latent-diffusion inpainting image generation model by introducing a pseudo 3D convolution approach. This technique enables separate convolutions across the spatial dimension in 2D and the temporal dimension in 1D, allowing the model to capture spatial and temporal information effectively.

          Additionally, we incorporated temporal attention through self-attention mechanisms that independently attend to the temporal dimension, enhancing the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies within the generated images. The combination of pseudo 3D convolution and temporal attention improves the model's performance in generating high-quality, coherent images while preserving temporal consistency in video sequences. Moving forward, these advancements set the stage for further refinements and enhancements in the subsequent stages of training for our image generation project.
